But, after going to the market, I arrived in home and watching the unreleased video by Seventeen In The Soop, and played Don't Starve Together with my little cousin, Isabela. She is not good kkkk but was fun this time. We die, and it is impossible keep this save, it's winter and we can't get warm.

                <p>Today is sunday and now is 22h53. I arrived in some minutes ago to my cousin's house. My cousin, Milena, she get aproved in the university and today we had a barbecue to celebrate her achivements. We watched a movie that I don't remeber the name, but it is about a trip to the moon and has chineses characters, I think. Hum, I watched my cousins and their cousins playing domino. And we had a lot of diferent topic of talk, since the ex-girlfriend of my brother to laws things or moments that happened in the past. And, I really enjoyed this talk time. I feel connected with them, and I would had like to taked more time there, but it was late, so me and my mom come back to our home. 
                <br><br>And before we go to the "party", I went to the hospital with my dad, he is dramatic but I know that his throut is really damage. Honestly, he could had go to the hospital by himself, but a lot of times he costum to act like a child, and I get mad with that. Anyways, he had nothing serious, and he will be better after rest and take medicines.
                <br><br>After arrived in home, I talked a little with my mom, take care of my dog and came to the computer. I installed some softwares and I am writing this right now. I will watching some videos on youtube soon, Going Seventeen, I really like the Bad Clue episode, so I will watch again, I wanna laugh a little before sleep.

                    Hi. Today I went back to the routine and it was tiring. I hate have to waking up so early but I need that. I didn't a lot of things in my job, so I toke my free time to work on this diary, designing and coding, and I'm enjoying the result, but I have more things to improve here. I listened to some music and watched some reels on youtube.<br><br>
                    Oh, yesterday I watched the special episode from Going Seventeen and it is so hilarious, I laughed a lot, and in a little while I will watch the new episode that came out last week, I think. I had workout today, I didn't want to do -> again <- but I did. <br><br>
                    About yesterday, I cleaned my  room. It's not perfect, but it's not  rubbish either. I made my new planner for the week, and I hope that this time I can finish everything. I bough many things today, a new laptop battery, things for my room, underwears, bikini, a pair of shoes. I think it was a good shopping.

                    Let's start writing about yesterday. It was a horrible day. I sleept so bad, my insomnia don't help and my dog neither. I went to the job, I watched some videos, one of was an episode of Calamidade that I watched when I arrived in home until the end. I wanted to play with my little cousin and though about do workout, but I did't get up from my bed. I just stayed to lie there, listen music and I felt so upset with that.<br><br>
                    That wasn't a bad night like yesterday, but it was not good anyway. I arrived to work, again, the same routine, back to home in lunch time, and back to work. It is so tiring. I sleept for 30 minutes but I think that just make me feel more sleepy. I'm still working, wainting my dad arrived to go catch my mom. I got a little discussion with my dad in the car, he don't wanna take care of my grandmom, it is his responsability and she give money for us every month. It is like he don't want understand, I so tired of all of that.<br><br>
                    Anyway, I watched more RPG today and combined with my cousin to play for one hour when I arrived in home. I will workout, I will try do more exercises to get any result. I will watch The Last of Us tomorrow, I keep to postpone it, even that I want watch. I will watching some seventeen's videos to laugh a little, I need it. Probably the new Going Seventeen's new episode.
