                <p>Today is sunday and now is 22h53. I arrived in some minutes ago to my cousin's house. My cousin, Milena, she get aproved in the university and today we had a barbecue to celebrate her achivements. We watched a movie that I don't remeber the name, but it is about a trip to the moon and has chineses characters, I think. Hum, I watched my cousins and their cousins playing domino. And we had a lot of diferent topic of talk, since the ex-girlfriend of my brother to laws things or moments that happened in the past. And, I really enjoyed this talk time. I feel connected with them, and I would had like to taked more time there, but it was late, so me and my mom come back to our home. 
                <br><br>And before we go to the "party", I went to the hospital with my dad, he is dramatic but I know that his throut is really damage. Honestly, he could had go to the hospital by himself, but a lot of times he costum to act like a child, and I get mad with that. Anyways, he had nothing serious, and he will be better after rest and take medicines.
                <br><br>After arrived in home, I talked a little with my mom, take care of my dog and came to the computer. I installed some softwares and I am writing this right now. I will watching some videos on youtube soon, Going Seventeen, I really like the Bad Clue episode, so I will watch again, I wanna laugh a little before sleep.

                    Hi. Today I went back to the routine and it was tiring. I hate have to waking up so early but I need that. I didn't a lot of things in my job, so I toke my free time to work on this diary, designing and coding, and I'm enjoying the result, but I have more things to improve here. I listened to some music and watched some reels on youtube.<br><br>
                    Oh, yesterday I watched the special episode from Going Seventeen and it is so hilarious, I laughed a lot, and in a little while I will watch the new episode that came out last week, I think. I had workout today, I didn't want to do -> again <- but I did. <br><br>
                    About yesterday, I cleaned my  room. It's not perfect, but it's not  rubbish either. I made my new planner for the week, and I hope that this time I can finish everything. I bough many things today, a new laptop battery, things for my room, underwears, bikini, a pair of shoes. I think it was a good shopping.

                    Let's start writing about yesterday. It was a horrible day. I sleept so bad, my insomnia don't help and my dog neither. I went to the job, I watched some videos, one of was an episode of Calamidade that I watched when I arrived in home until the end. I wanted to play with my little cousin and though about do workout, but I did't get up from my bed. I just stayed to lie there, listen music and I felt so upset with that.<br><br>
                    That wasn't a bad night like yesterday, but it was not good anyway. I arrived to work, again, the same routine, back to home in lunch time, and back to work. It is so tiring. I sleept for 30 minutes but I think that just make me feel more sleepy. I'm still working, wainting my dad arrived to go catch my mom. I got a little discussion with my dad in the car, he don't wanna take care of my grandmom, it is his responsability and she give money for us every month. It is like he don't want understand, I so tired of all of that.<br><br>
                    Anyway, I watched more RPG today and combined with my cousin to play for one hour when I arrived in home. I will workout, I will try do more exercises to get any result. I will watch The Last of Us tomorrow, I keep to postpone it, even that I want watch. I will watching some seventeen's videos to laugh a little, I need it. Probably the new Going Seventeen's new episode.

                    Starting write about yesterday: it is a good day. I went to the korean restaurant called Burgogui with Gabi and João. We had lunch and talk a lot about many topics. The bad part it is I waste a lot of money, but the food was delicious. After that we went to João's house and watched "Deu a louca na chapeuzinho". It is a funny movie, I want watch because I see in some short videos the goat's song, the portuguese dubbing is amazing. My parents was tripped in the morning, I payed for they go. My cousins didn't go, so I was zero want to go too.<br><br>

                    But, cause my dad goes, I have to take care of my grandmom today. And was tranquil. But, to be honest, all that I want is lie down on my bed. It is a productive day, anyway. I finished a chapter of HTML and CSS. My dad arrived was 6pm, and he take me to home. I eat a little and watch something in youtube, but I was so tired.

                    Well, the air condicioner in my office is broken since monday and it is so hot. The man is trying fixed but I don't know how it is going. I watched the last episode from The Last of Us and I really enjoyed this serie.<br><br>
                    I am feeling so sick theses days so I asked to go more early to go to the doctor. I was a marked hour with a dermatologist so I went there, take more than one houre for the doctor call me, and the query during less than 5 minutes. She passes some soap and a cream to use in my acnes.<br><br>
                    In home, I eat cookies and get into the online query for the doctor, it is take a lot of time. She gave me one day of medical certificates I passes some medicines that I will not buy. In 4h30pm I went to the pscicologist but she it not there, so I back home to rest.

                    I am stil sick. Yesterday I went again to the doctor and she gave more two days in home and passes more medicines that I will not buy, but I taked some there. I haved to work from home, and my boss don't do the things right, and I don't have acess to the docs on my computer, so it is so dificulte to do. <br><br>
                    Today I decided to go work for only two hours, but this two hours became five. It was a lot of thing and they passes more thing, even they knowing that I am sick, and this make me feel so angry. When the clock is 12pm I go home and say to my boss that I will not come back in the afternoon.<br><br>
                    In home I listen some music, eat and in 4h30pm I went to the psicologist again. She don't help me a lot, just say me things that I already know. But I bought churros when I was back to home.I watched some seventeen's videos, going seventeen, that I love so much and laugh I little. I need that.

                    Yesteday we had a barbecue again! We go to my cousin's house, again, and it is was a really good time. I talk a lot with Milena, about many things, I eat too. After that we went to the kitchen and we made a cake while talking about work things. In the and, we forget to put sugar in the cake, so we have to fixed mading a coconut topping. We laugh so much and make funny about it.<br><br>
                    We watched the soccer game, I really wanted some goal from Sport, but it was 0 x 0. So sad. My brother and my cousin, Paulinho, was in the game to see. We waiting them arrived. But before that, we eaten some sandwiches with coffee, I talk a little with some family people about my dad situation, he is really fat and I can't do nothing more to help. It is frustrated.<br><br>
                    I talked with Paulinho about a new game that Alanzoka played and I interessed to but, but it is expensive. So I start to watching him playing.<br><br>
                    Today I did'nt nothing especial, just stayed in my bed and bough pizza for the dinner to me and my mom, and started to watch Caratland. I will watching in some parties, because it is a big video.
